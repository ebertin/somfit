This is V1.2.0 of SOMFit.
SOMFit computes Self-Organizing Maps for use as unsupervised classifiers in
SExtractor. It reads vignets from SExtractor "FITS_LDAC" catalogs and generates
a .som binary FITS file which can be loaded back in SExtractor (using the
SOM_NAME config parameters in default.sex) to provide a low-dimensional vector
of attributes VECTOR_SOMFIT().

In any case you can still reach me at bertin@iap.fr. I cannot garantee
that I will reply immediately, but I will try for sure to provide
an answer.
